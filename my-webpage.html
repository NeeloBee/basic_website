        <h2>Dutch</h2>
        Being quite good in Afrikaans, the third most widely spoken language in South Africa and a language known as the descendent of Dutch, I would love to learn Dutch, which has about 23 million native speakers. Dutch is spoken in Netherlands, Belgium French Flanders and Suriname amongst others. It is widely known that Dutch is a conservative language. I would also love to better understand the Dutch culture, more especially the sayings. Dutch being one of the easiest language to learn for English speakers, it ought to be fun to learn where the <em>de</em> and <em>het</em> go in each sentence. And lastly, Dutch sounds so cool to speak, it seems like a language that gives both your throat and tongue a good workout. Fun fact about the Dutch language: it like German, is able of forming compounds of potentially limitless length. The longest word contains 60 letters.

        <h2>Historical places in Kimberley, Northern Cape, South Africa</h2>
        <h3>The Big Hole </h3>
        The Big Hole is the deepest hole in the whole that was made by men, 463m wide, surface area of 17 hectares with depth of about 215metres and filled with 40% of water; you get to see real diamonds in a diamond vault; the water in the hole is a turquiose color from (apparently) the aftereffects.

        <h3>Ernest Oppenheimer Memorial Gardens and Diggers Fountain</h3>
         The bust of Oppenheimer, in marble, sits proudly overlooking the Rose Garden and Diggers Fountain. The presence of the fountain in the dry mining mining city is intended to be a symbol of hard work, economic success and good government. The Gardens are a memorial to the late Sir Ernest Oppenhemer, a diamond magnate and the fisrt elected mayor of the municipality of the city of Kimberey when Beaconsfiled and Kimberley were combined into a city in 1912.

       <h3>The Honoured Dead Memorial</h3>
        The Honoured Dead Memorial is situated at the meeting point of 5 roads, and commenmorates those who died defending the city during the 124 day Siege of Kimberley in the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902. The Neried Monument at Xanthus, Greece greatly influenced the design of this memorial.
